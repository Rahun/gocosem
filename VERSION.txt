1.0.0
======
Initial vesrion

1.0.1
======
fixed failing test TestMeter_ProfileTimeRange()

1.0.2
======
- refactor of logging
- AARQ asn1 encoding is hardcoded in go AARQ.encode() to avoid C-dependency,
but original asn1c encoder encode_AARQapdu()  is preserved and may be stil used, it's just not included in compilation

1.0.3
======
- fixed all race detector warnings, except one TestX_1000parallelRequests() which is probably false positive 
- lowered number of parallel requests to 1000 from 10000 in test TestX_1000parallelRequests() to avoid race detector to hit its limit on max number of parallel routines
